## Overview

A busy airport could have millions of people travelling through it every year. Consequently, there may be dozens of airplanes taking off and landing on an airport's runway every day. This raises a problem: How can we maximise the amount of planes that pass through an airport every day, while minimising the number of accidents?

Historically, the problem was addressed by teams of controllers, who would track the arrival and departure of planes, sending them from hangars to runways as each one became available. Unfortunately, there is a high cost to employing air traffic controllers and they are not immune to error. Of course, that is why you have come to us at Digital Futures to try and find a better solution!

Increasingly, industries are choosing to automate their operations rather than depend on humans to solve their business problems. There has been a clear trend towards automation over the last few decades, and the majority of predictions indicate that this tendency shows no signs of declining any time soon. For this reason, our team of software engineers has created a program that will control the flow of airplanes to and from Moorpath Airport.

## Benefits

Our software engineering team at Digital Futures has come to the conclusion that automation is a much safer alternative to human air traffic controllers. We have arrived at this conclusion by assessing the costs and the benefits of both automation and manual air traffic control. Below, we have laid out the most obvious benefits:

### Computers are more cost effective than humans

Work laws are much more favourable to employees now than they were in the past. As a consequence, much of the burden of the responsibility has been shifted to the companies that employ them, and so many are unable to employ the same number of workers as before. The amount of automation has dramatically increased over the past few decades, and so has productivity. Therefore, we believe that Moorpath Airport will be able to increase its profit margins by shifting some of its activities towards automation.

### Computers are less prone to error than humans

Working in air traffic control often requires long and unsociable hours. Humans are not naturally equipped to deal with such conditions, which makes them more likely to make mistakes, especially as they become tireder. The complexity that comes with air traffic also puts controllers under acute stress, which further increases the risk of a breakdown or health problem. On the other hand, computers will operate at a more or less continuous efficiency under a fixed set of conditions, and are able to handle all situations of a prescribed type in the same manner. At the end of the day, automation means that fewer lives are lost unnecessarily. 

### More automation means more time for checking work

As more responsibilities shift to computers, humans have more time for other responsibilities, including checking the decisions of the program (i.e. putting a "human in the loop"). We cannot promise that our software will never fail. However, with the working hours that are being saved, air traffic controllers will have the time to check that the software is doing its job correctly. As a result, the airport will likely operate at a significantly higher level of efficiency than it ever worked when it had only human air traffic controllers.

### More efficient use of runway time means more revenue

With the capability of computers to work at speeds which are unmatchable for humans, runway timeslots are allocated more quickly than if they were done manually. Thus, airline companies are able to purchase more slots, and Moorpath Airport can increase its revenue.

### Computers are immune to explicit corruption

"She's only human", is a common excuse that we use for flawed behaviour. We understand that we can be influenced, or corrupted, some of the time. However, air traffic controllers hold a lot of responsibility, and such excuses do not make up for the lives that are ruined or even that are sometimes lost as a result of bribery, blackmail and other forms of corruption. Many companies lose out on significant amounts of profits as a result of such deviant behaviour, which computers are otherwise immune to. Of course, computers are not without their vulnerabilities, which we will discuss in the risks section.

## Risks

While we believe that automation is a better alternative for air traffic control, we cannot ignore the risks that the implementation of our program creates. We have highlighted them below:

### Computers are vulnerable to security breaches

While computers cannot be bribed, they are only as resistant to security breaches as the systems they are built on. Passwords, keys, and security measures can all be exposed by vulnerable systems, disgruntled workers, or hackers. There are actions that can be implemented to reduce such risks, but it is unlikely to ever be eradicated.

### Computers need electricity

It is true that computers can function twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, but if there is a power outage, and no backup system in place, then there may as well be no controller at all. However, if a procedure is in place that handles situations where the power goes out, then the risk to human life is significantly reduced. Again, a "human in the loop" approach is key to maximising efficiency.

## Conclusion

Our team of Software Engineers at Digital Futures has been careful to assess and understand the risks associated with the implementation of our automated air traffic control program. We strongly believe that, provided the program is combined with rigorous security and infrastructure systems, Moorpath Airport will be able to free up more time for its clients, the airline companies, and provide safer travel experiences for the passengers that travel through the airport.
