## User Stories

- As a **member of the airport operations staff**, I want to be able to see the occupancy of the various hangars and spaces of the airport, so that I can coordinate incoming and outgoing aircraft to the appropriate spaces.
- As a **member of the maintenance team**, I want to be able to override the default capacity of each of the spaces of the airport, so that I can allocate more aircraft to an area when there is a high demand for airport space.
- As a **hacker/disgruntled employee**, I want to be able to decrease the default capacity of a space below its current occupancy, so that I can give the impression that the space is full when it is not.
- As a **hacker/disgruntled employee**, I want to be able to increase the default capacity of an airport space well above its normal capacity, so that there is an increased risk of accidents.
- As a **pilot**, I want to be able to enter the airspace of the airport, so that I can request clearance for landing.
- As a **pilot**, I want to be able to land the aircraft I am piloting, so that I can allow my passengers to disembark.
- As a **pilot**, I only want to be able to land the plane if the conditions are safe, so that I minimise the risk of an accident.
- As a **pilot**, I only want to receive accurate information, so that I can make the effective decisions regarding the aircraft I am piloting.

- As a **hacker/disgruntled employee**, I want to give clearance for landing to aircraft when the airport is full, so that I can cause an accident.
- As an **air traffic controller**, I do not want to clear a plane for landing when the airport is full, so that airport spaces are not over capacity in a way that causes a hazard.
- As an **air traffic controller**, I do not want to clear a plane for landing that is grounded at the airport, so that pilots do not receive confusing information.
- As a **hacker/disgruntled employee**, I want to clear planes for landing even when they are grounded, so that I can confuse pilots and increase the risk of accidents.
- As an **air traffic controller**, I only want to be able to clear planes for take off that are on the ground at the airport.
- As a **hacker/disgruntled employee**, I want to be able to clear planes for take off that are in the air, so that pilots are potentially confused and, therefore, increasing the risk of accidents.
- As a **meteorologist**, I want to be able to take away a plane's clearance for landing when the weather is stormy, so that the risk of an accident is minimised.
- As a **meteorologist**, I want to be able to take away a plane's clearance for take off when the weather is stormy, so that the risk of an accident is minimised.
- As a **hacker/disgruntled employee**, I want to be able to override the feature that takes away a plane's clearance due to bad weather, so that I can cause an accident.
